# spectrum_to_filtercurve_preset
Turn wavefile spectrum to FilterCurve profile (Audacity Helper)

This simple utility takes as input the textfile generated by the [Export...] button in Audacity's **Analyze>Plot spectrum...** view, and produces another textfile can be conveniently imported as a preset in Audacity *FilterCurve EQ* effect.
It can be handy if you wish to apply the frequency response of a reference audio file to another one.

In order to achieve the desired result, you should follow these steps:
1) In Audacity, export the *Plot spectrum* of the track you want to modify (track1) to spectrum1.txt
2) In Audacity, export the *Plot spectrum* of the track you want track1 to sound like (track2) to spectrum2.txt
3) Run spectrum_to_filtercurve_preset.py on both spectrum1.txt and spectrum2.txt (you'll obtain spectrum1_eq.txt and spectrum2_eq.txt)
4) In Audacity, open track1 and go to **Effect>FilterCurve EQ**, import spectrum1_eq.txt as a preset, INVERT IT and apply it
5) With track1 open in Audacity, go to **Effect>FilterCurve EQ**, import spectrum2_eq.txt as a preset and apply it

(Note: the script performs no math on the frequencies or the values, so it can equally manage both dot and comma as a decimal separator)
